# Audio Project

Project Name: Turbulence

Project Description: This project takes the user on a journey on an airplane with a realistic soundscape. We invite you to become one of the ADAA Airways passengers heading to Dubai with an amazing crew. However, not a long time after the departure airplane enters the area of turbulence, and things escalate very quickly. In the end, [spoiler], it crushes.
The audio and idea behind it are terrifying, but we are trying to make it less dark and scary by using the funky website design with a minimalistic touch. As a result, the experience we are striving to achieve is full of opposites: serious audio with bright pictures creates this contrast that only amplifies the impact of our project.

Process: At first, when we came up with the idea, we did research about airplane crashes, and what happens during the flight in such cases. We also brainstormed many sounds that reminded us of airplanes and created a soundscape that includes them all and allow a listener to feel like they are on the plane. We divided the work, so two of us, Abdul and Alima, worked primarily on the audio, while Aigerim and Dhurba were responsible for the website. We wanted the website to be just an addition to the audio, and that's why we chose a minimalistic style. You can see the wireframe here:

Alima drew all the pictures that we used on the website, and in the end, all of us were involved in coding. While working with the audio, we experimented with different effects, and used Graphic EQ, noise reduction, normalization, and amplifying. This was the most interesting part of the assignment - to wark with the sounds and make them sound the way we imagine them.  

Reflection/Evaluation: We are satisfied with the result, but while working we faced a few challenges which we successfully overcame! First, it was quite difficult to get into character and record the audio. It took us several takes until we got the recording we were satisfied with and we got Captain Aigerim, steward Abdul, and panicking woman Alima. Second, aligning the audio and visuals took much more than we expected. At one point, for us to test the audio we had to go through all 3 minutes. However, the result, in the end, was worth it.
